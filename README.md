# HMM POS Tagger (NLP)

This project implements several versions of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger using the Brown corpus. It includes:

- A baseline tagger based on most frequent tag
- A bigram HMM tagger using Viterbi decoding
- A version with Laplace (Add-One) smoothing
- A version using pseudo-words for unknown tokens
- Evaluation and confusion matrix analysis

**Dataset:** Brown corpus - news category (via NLTK)
